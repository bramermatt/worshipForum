# worshipForum

I love Jesus! And, I'm a worship leader at my church. 

## Why a forum?

I have to coordinate new songs, chord charts, practicing, and more, as a worship leader. And I love to talk to people.
I thought this would be a fun way to practice my software development skills, as well as, developing a place for worship leaders to talk. 

## Inspirations
Now, there of course are other places like this:
- Christian Forums
- Reddit
- Worship Together
and more.

## Why not build my own?
